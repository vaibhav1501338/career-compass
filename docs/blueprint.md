## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Forest green (#4CAF50), symbolizing growth, opportunity, and a fresh start.
- Background color: Very light green (#F1F8E9). It is the same hue as the primary color but much lighter and desaturated to create a calm and inviting background.
- Accent color: Yellow-Green (#8BC34A). This color will provide enough contrast to highlight interactive elements, and is analogous to the green hues of the overall theme.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings and prominent text. Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text and detailed descriptions. A clean and modern pairing to ensure readability and engagement.
- Use clear, professional icons to represent different career categories and actions, making the app intuitive and user-friendly.
- Implement a clean, modern layout with clear sections for each feature to ensure a seamless user experience.
- Subtle transitions and animations to provide visual feedback and enhance user engagement without being distracting.
